# SMKUI

SMKUI is the web user interface library of [The National Gallery of Denmark](http://smk.dk/en). Currently it's main focus is UI components for search and data retrieval, but SMKUI will encompass a wider range of components over time.

## Technologies used
Before diving into SMKUI to make changes or optimizations, you should be comfortable with the following technologies:

- [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) (used to build development and production versions of the source code)
- [Assemble](http://assemble.io/docs) (a Grunt plugin for generating static html pages)
- [Bower](http://bower.io) (used to manage frontend code packages)
- [Sass/Scss](http://sass-lang.com/documentation) (a css preprocessor that allows for a more maintanable, flexible, and object oriented style base)
